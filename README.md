# UnitConverter
I built a unit converter based on metric system so it'll be simpler than the ones out there.It's not thorough but useful since I usually do this conversions often. 

Things to work on:
1. There are limited units.
2. No settings currently. It's a 1-screen calculator
3. Design could be prettier.
4. IOS Version

30/6/2018: Working on Android version. Still clueless on IOS version. Do I need a Mac for this?
